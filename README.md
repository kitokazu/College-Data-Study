# College Salary Potential Study
## CPSC 392 FINAL

SEE PDF REPORT FOR ANALYSIS

Using college data (salary, diversity, salary potential) we answered the following questions:
* Is there a correlation between the average percentage of students in STEM, and early career pay or mid career pay?
* Does the number of students enrolled, race, and overall tuition vary depending on the type of school they attend (public, private). (find continuous variable and cluster and describe them)
* Is there a relationship between the state of school and the number of alumni who think they are making the world a “better place”? (just use plots)
* What is the average tuition cost for a student applying to a public school given that they are in state vs out of state.
* Is there a stronger linear relationship between the in state tuition vs early career pay or out of state tuition vs early career pay?
* Does race play a significant factor in student enrollment in school? (Many schools want diversity, but do they actually reach perfect diversity or still have a significant amount of a certain race?)?
* Check if the percentage of minorities of each school are over a certain percentage based on specific predictors?
* Is there a strong linear relationship between total (room and board and tuition) and career pay (early and mid) vs. making the world a better place? (one model for in_state_total and out of state total for each race)
