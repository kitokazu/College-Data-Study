    "Find a data set that's interesting to you. Make sure it has at least 7 variables and at least 100 rows, and at least 4 continus/interval columns. But the more the better. You may **NOT** use any of the datasets we've used in class (see [here](https://github.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC392ParlettPelleriti/tree/master/Data)).\n",

    "\n",
    "(**10 points**; Due Friday April 30th at 11:59pm; PDF) Pretend you're a company who is interested in the dataset you chose. Come up with at **least 7 questions** that you want to answer based on the variables (at the top of this document, **provide a short description of each of the variables in the model**).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions can be about the relationships between variables, or how well one thing can predict another, clustering...etc, but note that in your final project you must use at least **1 supervised learning model** (includes both regression and classification models), **1 clustering model, and 1 instance of dimensionality reduction** (PCA or LASSO), so keep that in mind when creating questions. You can use more than one of these for a single question (e.g. using PCA and then doing linear regression on the components).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be graded on the quality of the questions. Questions should be interesting and complex (e.g. questions like \"is this model more than 90% accurate?\" should be expanded to something like \"is this model accurate as measured by accuracy, examination of patterns in the confusion matrix and/or consistent accuracy across gender/race/income/education groups?\"). Questions related to the same model/analysis should be included as 1 question (for example, if you build a model predicting cat weight from cat height, cat age, and cat diet, the question should be somthing like \"which variables have the strongest impact on cat weight?\" instead of having three separate questions \"what is the impact of cat height on cat weight?\", \"what is the impact of cat age on cat weight?\", and \"\"what is the impact of cat diet on cat weight?\")\n",

    "### **3.**\n",
    "\n",
    "(**30 points**; Due Friday May 7th at 11:59pm; PDF) Now put on your data scientist hat. Write an **ORGANIZED analysis plan** to answer **3** of the questions you came up with. Think about which of the questions need a predictive model, which need a clustering model, which need dimensionality reduction, and which maybe need just visualizations/summaries. (at the top of this document, provide a short description of each of the variables in the model)\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> a) describe the analysis you're planning (include details like whether you're using standardization, regularization, model validation, distance/similarity metrics, how you'll choose clusters or hyperparameters, which variables you're using...etc)\n",

    "    <li> c) describe <b>two</b> ggplot data visualizations you'll use to support your answers (graphs must be in ggplot, the ONLY acception is a dendrogram for HAC). \n",

    "(**40 points**; Due Monday May 17th at 11:59pm; PDF of Jupyter Notebook) **Perform the planned analyses** (be sure to note in markdown if there were any changes to your analysis plan since part #3 and **why**), and **make the graphs in a python notebook**. You should also include written (in markdown) answers to each of the 3 questions that you asked:\n",

    "(**8 points**; Due by the start of your class final time; Video link) **Prepare a short presentation of the results** (powerpoint, prezi, keynote...etc, DO NOT just scroll through your notebook.). Make a short (3-5 minute, not under or over) **video presentation** explaining what you found. Upload it to youtube or similar site (you can put your video as Unlisted if you don't want anyone else to see)\n",

    "3. A **PDF** with your analysis plan.\n",
    "4. A **text submission or PDF** on Canvas with your critique of *another* students plan.\n",
    "5. A **PDF** of your python notebooks. Please get rid of extra analyses/code that you did not end up using. You must clearly indicate where each question is being answered. Also include a **README**.\n",
    "6. A **link** to a short video presentation (do not send the video directly). \n",
    "7. A **text submission or PDF** on Canvas with your peer video feedback.\n",

    "    <li> For Part I, #3 You should come up with the plan together and EACH submit a copy of the same plan. You need to answer 3 questions <b>per member</b> (so a group of 2 would need to answer 6 questions, a group of 3 would need to answer 9). \n",
    "    <li> For Part I, #4 You should write your critiques separately.\n",
    "    <li> For Part II, #5 You should work on it together (You can use Google Colab, it's like Google Docs for Jupyter notebooks, but without live updating$^{[1]}$), and EACH submit a copy of the notebook PDF. Again, you need to answer 3 questions <b>per member</b> (so a group of 2 would need to answer 6 questions, a group of 3 would need to answer 9).  <b>You must ALSO submit a joined statement (as a PDF) describing what each member did. Each of you should submit a copy of this.</b>\n",
    "    <li> For Part II, #6 You each need to make your OWN video presenting on 3 of the questions each, however you can collaborate on the presentation materials (the slides..etc). Each of you should submit a separate video.\n",
    "    <li> For Part II #7 You need to each do separate peer reviews.\n",
